Go here, kill this boss. Just about every single quest in the game is a copy-paste of previous quests. There is no attempt to encourage the player to do anything else, to talk to this mob, to have to investigate anything, to have to make any kind of decisions. It is soul-less. You can make more experience and level up faster simply by doing the town board quests. Pathetic.",
