Pytest fixtures with context manager

Create a simple function, which performs any logic of your choice with text data, 
which it obtains from a file object, passed to this function ( def test(file_obj) ).

Create a test case for this function using pytest library (https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html).

Create pytest fixture, which uses your implementation of the context manager to return a file object, 
which could be used inside your function.
